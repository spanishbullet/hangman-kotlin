# Overview
## Kotlin Hangman Game
This software is a command-line version of the classic Hangman game, written in Kotlin. The player guesses letters to try to uncover a hidden word. The game continues until the player has used up their attempts or correctly guessed the word.

The purpose of writing this software was to demonstrate the use of various Kotlin language features, including variables (mutable and immutable), expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes. It also showcases how to handle user input and output in a command-line application.

# Development Environment
The software was developed using IntelliJ IDEA, a popular IDE for Kotlin development. The Kotlin plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, which provides first-class support for Kotlin, was also used.
IntelliJ IDEA for Kotlin.

### Integrated Kotlin Support: 
1. IntelliJ IDEA has built-in support for Kotlin, which was developed by JetBrains, the same company that developed IntelliJ IDEA. This means that Kotlin and IntelliJ IDEA are designed to work seamlessly together.
2. Smart Coding Assistance: IntelliJ IDEA provides smart coding assistance for Kotlin such as auto-completion, code navigation, and quick fixes, which can significantly speed up your development process. 
3. Built-in Tools and Frameworks: IntelliJ IDEA comes with built-in tools and frameworks for Kotlin development, such as a debugger, testing tools, and build tools like Gradle and Maven. 
4. Refactoring Capabilities: IntelliJ IDEA has robust refactoring capabilities that work excellently with Kotlin. You can easily change the structure of your code without changing its behavior. 
5. Interoperability with Java: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, and IntelliJ IDEA makes it easy to convert Java code to Kotlin and vice versa.

### GitHub for Kotlin Projects:

1. Version Control: GitHub is a platform that provides git version control, which is essential for managing and tracking changes to your Kotlin project, especially when working in a team. 
2. Collaboration: GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with others. You can invite others to contribute to your project, review code, manage pull requests, and track issues. 
3. Integration with IDEs: GitHub integrates well with IntelliJ IDEA and other IDEs, making it easy to push changes directly from your IDE to GitHub. 
4. Documentation and Community: GitHub allows you to add a README file to your repository where you can document your project. It also has a large community where you can find a wealth of open-source Kotlin projects for learning and inspiration. 
5. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitHub provides features like Actions which help in automating the software workflow. This is very useful for building, testing, and deploying your Kotlin applications.

# Future Work
 - Add error handling for invalid inputs.
 - Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game.
 - Expand the list of words and categorize them by difficulty level.
